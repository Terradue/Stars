| sat:absolute_orbit | | | NOT AVAILABLE |
| view:incidence_angle | /product/sceneAttributes/imageAttributes/incAngNearRng & /product/sceneAttributes/imageAttributes/incAngFarRng | [42.38,43.82] | The incidence angle is the angle between the incident SAR beam and the axis perpendicular to the local geodetic ground surface (from target point of view). It ranges from Near Incidence Angle to Far Incidence Angle. Reference angles are available at https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/technical-features/characteristics.asp. Values in spec tables can be identified using the code extracted from /product/sourceAttributes/beamModeMnemonic. E.g. '3M24' 41,04 (near) 42,36 (far) |
| view:off_nadir |  | | The off-nadir angle (or look angle) is the angle between the satellite's nadir position and the SAR beam (from instrument point of view). |
| sar:observation_direction | /product/sourceAttributes/radarParameters/antennaPointing | right | Antenna pointing direction, string: as "right" or "left". |
| sar:instrument_mode | /product/sourceAttributes/beamMode | QP | REQUIRED, 'SC100' for Low resolution 100m (ScanSAR); 'SC50','SC30', and '16M' for Medium Resolution at 50m (ScanSAR), 30m (ScanSAR), and 16m (StripMap); '5M' for High Resolution 5m (StripMap); '3M' for Very High Resolution 3m (StripMap); 'LN' for Low Noise; 'SD' for Ship Detection; 'QP' for quad-polarization; and 'FSL' for Spotlight. |
| sar:frequency_band | | C | HARDCODED it is a SAR-C instrument |
| sar:center_frequency | /product/sourceAttributes/radarParameters/radarCenterFrequency | 5.405 | From Hertz to GigaHertz |
| sar:polarizations | /product/sourceAttributes/radarParameters/polarizations | [HH, HV, VH, VV] | REQUIRED 'CH and CV' stands for compact (RH and RV). RCM in compact polarization transmits in circular polarization and receives in dual linear polarization. RCM 5M data products are given in the following polarizations: Single (HH or HV or VH or VV), Dual-cross (HH or VV and HV), Dual-copol (HH and VV), or Compact (RH and RV). |
| sar:product_type | /product/imageGenerationParameters/generalProcessingInformation/productType | GRD | REQUIRED: typical RCM data products are: Single-look complex (SLC), Multilook complex (GRC), Ground-range detected (GRD), Geocoded complex (GCC), Geocoded detected data (GCD) |
| processing:level | | | NONE |
